Hi, I'm Jackson Miller, a software developer living in Charlotte, NC
I primarily work in TypeScript, writing back-end API's for a startup bank's core systems.  But, I also use C# and React to write small apps for use around the home.  I'm passionate about automation and am building a homelab off of a Raspberry Pi based Kubernetes cluster.
