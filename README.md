Hi, I'm Jackson Miller, a software developer living in Columbia, SC

I primarily work in C#, writing back-end API's for a medium-sized bank's core systems.  But, I also use TypeScript and React to write small apps for use around the home.  I'm passionate about automation and am building a homelab off of a Raspberry Pi based Kubernetes cluster.
